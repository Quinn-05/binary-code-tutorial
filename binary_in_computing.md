# Binary in Computing

In digital computing, everything—from numbers to images and videos—is represented in binary code. Computers use binary for storing data, processing information, and communicating between devices.

## How Computers Use Binary
- **Data Storage**: Hard drives, SSDs, and memory stores data as binary (bits). For instance, each bit can represent a switch being on or off, corresponding to the presence or absence of data.
- **Processing**: The CPU performs all of its computations in binary. Complex operations like addition, subtraction, and even multiplication are done using binary logic.
- **Communication**: When computers send or receive data over networks, the data is transmitted in binary. This allows the transfer of images, videos, text, and other forms of digital media.

Understanding binary code helps you grasp the fundamental principles of how computers operate at the most basic level.
